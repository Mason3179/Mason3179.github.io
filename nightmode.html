            <br> Sliced Corpse. Ah. I am entirely obsessive when all is lost. I cannot lose this obsession. II want to break myself so badly. I want you to  suffer as well, of cousrse. And you, I(you) iwll evneer know who youy are., You are bound to unhappiness. I wamt to slice. everywhere. I never wnt you to see this. Ther;s a good chance you don't. Even in the case that you tdo, will you know it's ytou? How can I discern the person I am talking to in the present moment? WIthout confusing them with the last? Perhaps only I can tell. Maybe context can give it away. These are my vent thoughts, and they are to be thrown away. <br>
            I am a pitiful human. I sometimes wish so hard that I could be something else. that I could destroy my preconvieved notions, affections, lusts and desires. I want to tear you apart with my teeth sometimes. Argh. Who will find this? I want want want want want want want want. It's all I do.Perhaps I could kill you someday. But for now, I'll continue on killing myself.
            <br>
            Argh. Until nexttime!

            Argh. At nighttime I become obsessed with you sometimes. I wish you knew who you were. I wish I could eat you. I wish I could destroy you... hehe. My unfiltered thoughts will go here, when I can't sleep and I have my computer at hand. I want to ruin you. I want you to ruin me. I need to become stronger for my own good. What happened to when I was happy? Why am I so behind on life? I'm exhausted, but I still love you, I think. Asshole. <br>
        -Asshole<br>
        <br>
        P.S.: I hate everyone and all who are nosy. I hate those who feel the need to poke into my life for their own enjoyment. Why can't I be left alone? Why do I take the little privacy I do have to my advantage? Dead or alive, I am bound to lose. It seems. Urgh.<br>
