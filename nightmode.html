        Argh. At nighttime I become obsessed with you sometimes. I wish you knew who you were. I wish I could eat you. I wish I could destroy you... hehe. My unfiltered thoughts will go here, when I can't sleep and I have my computer at hand. I want to ruin you. I want you to ruin me. I need to become stronger for my own good. What happened to when I was happy? Why am I so behind on life? I'm exhausted, but I still love you, I think. Asshole. <br>
